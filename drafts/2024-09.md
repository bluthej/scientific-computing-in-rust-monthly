# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #2

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items
[here](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly#contributing-an-item).

## Crate of the month: rsmpi
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mpi) ~ [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/mpi) ~ [source](https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi)

You really can't get too far in scientific computing without doing something in parallel, and you really can't get too far into
parallelising your code without MPI (the Message Passing Interface). The rsmpi crate provides interfaces to MPI from Rust.

## New releases

### [ndgrid v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/ndgrid) and [ndelement v0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/ndelement)
ndelement is a finite element definition library that can create finite elements on a reference cell,
and compute their values and derivatives. ndgrid is a library for handling finite element grids/meshes.
In its first release, ndgrid supports grids of interval, triangle, and quadrilataral cells stored
in serial or in parallel, with parallel mesh partitioning carried out using [coupe](https://crates.io/crates/coupe).

### [ndarray v0.16.0](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)
Ndarray implements an n-dimensional container for general elements and for numerics.
Ndarray had its long outstanding v0.16.0 release recently which brought some larger changes and many bugfixes. Ndarray has since also followed up with some minor fixes in v0.16.1.
See the full release notes: [v0.16.0](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/releases/tag/0.16.0), [v0.16.1](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray/releases/tag/0.16.1)
for more details.

## Miscellaneous

### ndarray maintainership roundtable and design discussions
Discussions are currently taking place around how to reinforce the maitainership of ndarray, as well as
ndarray-linalg and ndarray-stats. There are also some ongoing discussions to re-think some of the design
decisions, with a desire to build a common base for ndspans or ndarrays in Rust more broadly, not limited
to the ndarray crate itself.
