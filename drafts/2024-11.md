# Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly #4

Welcome to this month's issue of Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly.

<!-- Editor can write a 2-3 sentence introduction here -->

Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly can be viewed online at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly),
you can sign up to receive an email copy at [mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs](https://mailinglist.scientificcomputing.rs),
or you can subscribe using the RSS feed at [scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml](https://scientificcomputing.rs/monthly/rss.xml).

Items can be added to the next issue of the newsletter by opening a pull request to the
[Scientific Computing in Rust Monthly repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly).
You can find more information about adding items
[here](https://github.com/rust-scicomp/scientific-computing-in-rust-monthly#contributing-an-item).

## Crate of the month: CRATE-NAME
<!--
The crate of the month will be picked by the editor, who will write a brief description of it here.
If you'd like to suggest a crate that we could include here, tell us on the rust-scicomp Zulip chat
(https://rust-scicomp.zulipchat.com/login/).

## New releases
<!--
This section can be used to announce new released of libraries. Items should
be sorted in alphabetical order and should use the format:

### [<library name> <release number>](<crates.io link>)
<brief description of the library and its new features in this release>
-->

### [integraal 0.1.0](https://crates.io/crates/integraal)

The `integraal` crate features a main structure that acts as the entrypoint for your integral computations. You can
specify the domain and the function of the integral, as well as the approximation rule using methods of the structure.
It follows a builder-like pattern.

Domains and functions are described using struct enums for the sake of flexibility. The repository contains
usage examples for both analytical expression and sampled values integration. Multiple numerical integration methods
are implemented, each having different requirements and dependencies. All of this is detailed in the documentation.

In the future, the computation kernel may support different execution backends. This would align with the initial
motivation behind this crate, that is being an experiment over flexible API designs for HPC.

## Events
<!--
This section can be used to advertise events. Items should be sorted in date order, with
sooner events first, and should use the format:

### [<event name>, <location or "held virutally">, <date>](<website URL>)
<brief description of event>
-->

## Publications
<!--
This section can be used to publicise papers, articles and blog posts published about scientific computing in Rust.
Items should be sorted in the alphabetical order of the surname of the first listed author.
Papers posted should use the following format:

### [<authors>, <title>, <journal> <volume>](<DOI>)
<brief description of paper>

Other publications should use the following format:

### [<author>, <title>](<link>)
<brief description>
-->

## Jobs
<!--
This section can be used to advertise jobs that may be of interest. Items should be sorted in the
order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<job title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of job, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

## Studentships
<!--
This section can be used to advertise studentships (eg PhDs, Master's programmes) that may be of interest.
Items should be sorted in the order in which they are added and should use the format:

### [<title>, <location>](<more information URL>)
<description of studentship, including how to apply and deadline>
-->

### [PhD opportunities, University College London and Imperial College London](https://ccmi-cdt.org/)
There are a large number of upcoming PhD opportunities at University College London (UCL) and Imperial College London
as part of the Collaborative Computational Modelling at the Interface (CCMI) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT).
A list of available projects being offered as part of the CDT can be found at
[ccmi-cdt.org/phd_projects/phd_project_list.html](https://ccmi-cdt.org/phd_projects/phd_project_list.html).
In particular, the project "Fast Multipole Methods on modern architectures" offered by Timo Betcke will build
upon existing Rust codes, although there may be opportunities to use Rust in a number of other projects.

## Help wanted
<!--
If you're looking for people to help develop or maintain a project, you can add it here. Items here
should be sorted in alphabetical order by project name and use the format:

### [<library name>](<link to source code repository>)
<brief description of the library and what kind of help you're interested in>
-->

## Miscellaneous
<!--
Any items that do not fit into any other section can be added here.
